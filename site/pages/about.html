    title: About this site
    description: >-
      This site was created as part of the Inaugural International [11ty
      Symposium](https://conf.11ty.dev/) on Making Websites Real Good. The
      organization and syndication of the content on this site demonstrates
      features of [CloudCannon’s Git-based headless
      CMS](https://cloudcannon.com/) and the open-source static API generator
      [Flatlake](https://flatlake.app/).


      (The content itself — fictional news articles and earnings reports for
      undisclosed financial quarters — is mostly nonsense. But it was fun to
      write.)


      The main site of this network, realbig.company, aggregates and
      redistributes news articles from each of its subsidiary sites, using
      Flatlake.


      Using CloudCannon’s [Site
      Mounting](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/site-mounting/)
      feature, each of the subsidiary sites shares a common source folder of
      page components, meaning that content editors on any one of the sites have
      access to exactly the same page elements. Similarly, Site Mounting allows
      for multiple sites to share the same layout files, for a cohesive visual
      identity.


      The source code for all parts is available at the [Real Big Company
      organization in GitHub](https://github.com/Real-Big-Company/).


      For a less fictional example of how these approaches might work, and a
      more detailed explanation, see
