# Real Big Company

This site was created as part of the Inaugural International [11ty
Symposium](https://conf.11ty.dev/) on Making Websites Real Good. The
organization and syndication of the content on this site demonstrates
features of [CloudCannon’s Git-based headless
CMS](https://cloudcannon.com/) and the open-source static API generator
[Flatlake](https://flatlake.app/).

(The content itself — fictional news articles and earnings reports for
undisclosed financial quarters — is mostly nonsense. But it was fun to
write.)

The main site of this network, realbig.company, aggregates and
redistributes news articles from each of its subsidiary sites, using
Flatlake.

Using CloudCannon’s [Site
Mounting](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/site-mounting/)
feature, each of the subsidiary sites shares a common source folder of
page components, meaning that content editors on any one of the sites have
access to exactly the same page elements. Similarly, Site Mounting allows
for multiple sites to share the same layout files, for a cohesive visual
identity.

For a less fictional example of how these approaches might work, and a
more detailed explanation, see
